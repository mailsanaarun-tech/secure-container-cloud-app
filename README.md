Securing a Containerized Application in the Public Cloud

# 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to securely build, containerize, and deploy a simple web application in a public cloud environment using industry best practices. The main focus is on container security, cloud IAM, network security, runtime hardening, logging & monitoring, and incident response planning.

The application is containerized using Docker and follows secure container image practices such as using minimal base images, running as a non-root user, and avoiding hard-coded secrets.
